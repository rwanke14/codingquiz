# codingquiz

I've created a Doctor Who based quiz that filters through a handful of questions about the TV series. This is a timed quiz set to 60 seconds with a timer at the top of the page

If the user answers correctly they will gain 10 points and add 15 seconds, but if they answer wrong they will lose 5 points and lose 15 seconds.

When an answer is selected the questions filter to the next question. Last page displays a list of high scores sorted.

There is still a lot I can do to fine tune this project.

I worked with classmates to work through my code for this HW and below are a link to their githubs. Areas such as the for loop and pushing storage into a high score section were the main areas I worked with them on to better understand what I needed to do. 

Feedback, brainstorming, and general support to study group:

Additionally I got ideas from these youtube videos (mainly to help me think through the logic of what I was trying to build out.):

As always I referenced W3Schools and MDN for additonal resources while putting things together.

Photos of final product are located in asset folder.
